#Write a short summary of your findings and also include your interpretation.
#In these findings, you should record the alignment score and the percentage of identical amino acids for each comparison.
#Your interpretation should state what biological, or evolutionary, interpretation you think we can make from these data.

#Summary of alignment results

human gene and mouse gene
distance: 23
percentage of identical amino acids: 89.64%
alignment score: 1091

human gene and random gene
distance: 210
percentage of identical amino acids: 5.41%
alignment score: -250

mouse gene and random gene
distance: 209
percentage of identical amino acids: 5.86%
alignment score: -250

#My thoughts
The distance between the human gene and mouse gene is much smaller than either of them with random genes.
Their percentage of identical amino acids and alignment score are also high.
Maybe there are some evolutionary relationships between them.
